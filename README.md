## SDPT3 version 4.0: MATLAB software for semidefinite-quadratic-linear programming
### [Kim-Chuan Toh](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/index.html), [Michael J. Todd](http://people.orie.cornell.edu/miketodd/todd.html), and [Reha H. Tütüncü](http://www.math.cmu.edu/~reha/)

SDPT3 is a Matlab package for solving convex optimization problems involving linear equations and inequalities, second-order cone constraints, and semidefinite constraints (linear matrix inequalities).

This is an *unofficial* repository for SDPT3. The [official SDPT3 site](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/sdpt3.html) is administered by [Kim-Chuan Toh](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/index.html), co-author of SDPT3 and professor of mathematics at the National University of Singapore.

This repo is administered by [Michael Grant](http://cvxr.com/bio), the developer of [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx), a modeling framework for convex optimization that uses SDPT3 as a solver. *It is not our intent for this repo to become an independent fork of SDPT3*. To that end:

   + We will periodically monitor the [official site](http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/sdpt3.html) for updates, and incorporate any we find into this repo. 
   + Any improvements that we make will be submitted to the authors for inclusion in the official release.

While you are welcome to submit bug reports on the [GitHub issue page](https://github.com/mcg1969/SDPT3/issues) for this repo, we cannot guarantee that they will be addressed in a timely fashion.
